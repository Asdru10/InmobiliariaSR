# Inmobiliaria San Ramón
This project is a real estate management and listing platform developed as part of an academic course, inspired by Airbnb-style marketplaces.
The platform allows users to publish and browse property listings, including houses, apartments, commercial spaces, and other rental properties. Each listing can include images, detailed descriptions, pricing information, and geographic location displayed through a map API.
The system supports role-based access, where:
### Property owners can create, edit, and remove their listings
### Potential buyers or renters can browse properties, apply filters, like listings, save them to favorites, and contact property owners
The project focuses on user experience, catalog management, and interactive features, simulating the core functionality of a modern real estate rental platform.
